# py3_bt_camp_notes
Collection of notes from python3 boot camp course by Colt Steele

These files do no work together. They are simply notes, exercises, and coding notes (e.g. examples of topics discussed 
created to give concreate ideas to abstract concepts)

Probably could get better notes from whatever files he has on there honestly but I didn't use the code that he had pre-written.
