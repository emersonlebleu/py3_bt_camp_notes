#---Web Scraping---#

#---Download, Extract, Do something with data---#

#---Why scrape?---#
#Usually because something doesnt have an API and you want to use their data
#You want to analyze or store or steal it?

#---Is it okay?---#
#some websites dont want you to scrape them but the /robots.txt file (where you dont want robots)
#space the requests out and don't be rediculous dont use it for weird reasons 

#--Beautiful Soup--#
#allows us to sort through HTML but it does not pull down the HTML for us
#we have to make our own commands to pull down the HTML
